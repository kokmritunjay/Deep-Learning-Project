# Deep-Learning-Project
Detection of Terrorism in the Cyberspace

# Project abstract
We collect information from twitter. We shall do a basic keyword based filtering to find out relevant information that is related to violence. Filtered data of different sources will then be used for mapping information of different sources as well as for feature extraction. In mapper, we shall map corresponding information from different sources. In feature extraction part, we shall be extracting different types of features:
  1) image based feature
  2) text based feature
  3) user social feature
  4) temporal features. 
 Validator will take features as input and mapping from the mapper and decide if it is really violence provoking information if it is then validator will annotate the information accordingly using machine learning techniques and also send the information to visualization tool for showing the violence provoking incident visually.
